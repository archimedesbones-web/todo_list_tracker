# Build and Publish (Windows)

This guide shows how to build a single-file Windows executable and publish the project to GitHub.

Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+ installed and on PATH
- Git installed

1. Prepare the repository

```powershell
cd \path\to\todo_list_tracker
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
```

2. Build the executable (Windows)

Double-click `build.bat` or run in PowerShell:

```powershell
.\build.bat
```

This will create `dist\todo_list_tracker.exe` which includes the `data` directory.

3. Test the executable

Run the exe and verify it works. It will create a `data\tasks.json` in the same directory where the executable runs.

4. Publish to GitHub

- Create a repository on GitHub (via website)
- Add the remote and push:

```powershell
git remote add origin https://github.com/<username>/<repo>.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

5. Create a release (optional)

- On GitHub, create a Release and upload the `dist\todo_list_tracker.exe` as an asset.

Notes
- The `data` directory is excluded from the repo by `.gitignore` to avoid committing user data. If you want to include example data, add it to `data/example_tasks.json` and commit explicitly.
- The `.spec` file generated by PyInstaller can be edited to customize bundling behavior.
