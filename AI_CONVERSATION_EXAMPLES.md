# AI Task Assistant - Conversation Examples

## How It Works
The AI assistant is now **conversational and adaptive** - it remembers context, handles uncertainty, and asks follow-up questions to help you brainstorm tasks.

**You:** "I don't know, maybe home workouts?"
**AI:** *Provides guidance questions:*
- Weight loss, muscle gain, or general health?
